/**
 * Class which represents a web server. This server implementation uses threads
 * from a pool to serve the incoming connections.<br><br>
 *
 * After creation request handlers should be registered in a server to handle
 * requests. This can be done using
 * {@link #addRequestHandler(java.lang.String, com.oracle.jmee.samples.webserver.RequestHandler)}
 * method by specifying the handler and associated with it context path. Context
 * path is a starting part of the URI request path that is used to locate the
 * specific request handler to serve the request. It is possible to add handlers
 * after the server has been started but it is advised to have all handlers
 * added in advance in order not to miss any client requests.<br><br>
 *
 * It is also possible to configure the web server by setting persistent
 * connections handling policy and a size of the transfer buffer. Since web
 * server supports both HTTP 1.0 and 1.1 versions, it supports persistent
 * connections if the client HTTP request suggests their usage. By default
 * persistent connections support is enabled. It can be changed using the
 * {@link #setPersistConnections(boolean)} method. The server is written to use
 * the optional Java ME feature of socket timeout to prevent web server from
 * hanging, but it may be not implemented on the specific platform. These
 * parameters may be set at any time of the web server work, but it is advised
 * to set them up prior to starting for a consistent user-experience of
 * clients<br><br>
 *
 * After that web server may be started using {@link #start()} method. Use
 * {@link #stop()} method in order to stop the server. It is possible to restart
 * the server after stopping by calling the same {@link #start()}
 * method.<br><br>
 *
 * This class differs from the one which is used in the full version of the
 * demo: support of multiple working threads was removed.
