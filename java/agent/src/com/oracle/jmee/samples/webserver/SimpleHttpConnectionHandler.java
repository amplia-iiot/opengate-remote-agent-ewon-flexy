/**
 * Class which purpose is to handle a web server client connection according to
 * the HTTP 1.1. This class performs HTTP request receiving, handling it and
 * sending of the HTTP response in the {@link #run()} method, which is intended
 * to be executed by a {@link Thread}.<br><br>
 *
 * Instances of this class may be configured with a receiving buffer size and a
 * persistent connection handling policy. It is allowed to set whether it is
 * needed to persist connections if protocol suggests it or not by calling
 * {@link #setShouldPersistConnection(boolean)}. HTTP 1.1 persistent connections
 * are defined in the <a
 * href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-6.3">Persistence paragraph
 * of the RFC 7230</a>. By default connections are persisted if HTTP request
 * suggests it.<br><br>
 *
 * This class uses the provided handlers registry to locate the appropriate
 * handler.
